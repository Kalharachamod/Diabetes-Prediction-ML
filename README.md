# Loan Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data such as income, credit history, and loan amount.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various applicant features including demographic and financial information alongside loan approval status.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load and explore the dataset to understand feature distributions and missing values.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and balance the dataset if necessary.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **Model Training**  
   Train classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

6. **Visualization**  
   Use charts to visualize feature importance and model performance.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
```

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Loan-Prediction-Model.git](https://github.com/yourusername/Loan-Prediction-Model.git)

```

2. Install dependencies  
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Run the main script  
```

python loan\_prediction.py

```

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of around **[insert accuracy]%** and demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for loan approvals.
